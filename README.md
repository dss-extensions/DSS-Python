# DSS Python: Unofficial bindings for EPRI's OpenDSS

Python bindings and misc tools for using OpenDSS (EPRI Distribution System Simulator). Based on CFFI and DSS C-API, aiming for full COM compatibility on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

See also the other projects from [DSS-Extensions.org](https://dss-extensions.org/):

- [DSS C-API library](http://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/): the base library that exposes a slightly modified version of EPRI's OpenDSS through a more traditional C interface, built with the open-source Free Pascal compiler instead of Delphi.
- [OpenDSSDirect.py](http://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.py/): if you don't need COM compatibility, or just would like to check its extra funcionalities. You can mix DSS Python and OpenDSSDirect.py -- for example, if you have old code using the official COM objects, you could quickly switch to DSS Python with very few code changes, and then use [`opendssdirect.utils`](https://dss-extensions.org/OpenDSSDirect.py/opendssdirect.html#module-opendssdirect.utils) to generate some DataFrames.
- [OpenDSSDirect.jl](http://github.com/dss-extensions/OpenDSSDirect.jl/): a Julia module, created by Tom Short (@tshort), recently migrated with the help of Dheepak Krishnamurthy (@kdheepak) to DSS C-API instead of the DDLL.
- [DSS Sharp](http://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_sharp/): available for .NET/C#, also mimics the COM classes, but Windows-only at the moment. Soon it will be possible to use it via COM too.
- [DSS MATLAB](http://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_matlab/): presents multi-platform integration (Windows, Linux, MacOS) with DSS C-API and is also very compatible with the COM classes.

Version 0.10.7, based on OpenDSS revision 2963 (OpenDSS v9.1.3.4). While we plan to add a lot more funcionality into DSS Python, the main goal of creating a COM-compatible API has been reached. If you find an unexpected missing feature, please report it!

This module mimics the COM structure (as exposed via `win32com` or `comtypes`), effectively enabling multi-platform compatibility at Python level.
Most of the COM documentation can be used as-is, but instead of returning tuples or lists, this modules returns/accepts NumPy arrays for numeric data exchange. 

The module depends on CFFI, NumPy and, optionally, SciPy.Sparse for reading the sparse system admittance matrix.

## Recent changes

**Changes in 0.10.7, since 0.10.6**

Check the [changelog](docs/changelog.md#0107) document for a detailed list for all releases.

- Simple maintenance release. 
- Updated to DSS C-API 0.10.7, which includes most changes up to OpenDSS v9.1.3.4.
- Includes an important bug fix related to the `CapRadius` DSS property. If your DSS scripts included the pattern `GMRac=... rad=...` or `GMRac=... diam=...` (in this order and without specifying `CapRadius`), you should upgrade and re-evaluate the results. 
- New API properties ported from the official COM interface: `Bus.AllPCEatBus`, `Bus.AllPDEatBus`, `CktElement.TotalPowers`, `Meters.ZonePCE`

## Missing features and limitations

Most limitations are inherited from `dss_capi`, i.e., these are not implemented:

- `DSSEvents` from `DLL/ImplEvents.pas`: seems too dependent on COM.
- `DSSProgress` from `DLL/ImplDSSProgress.pas`: would need a reimplementation depending on the target UI (GUI, text, headless, etc.).
- OpenDSS-GIS features are not implemented since they're not open-source.

In general, the DLL from `dss_capi` provides more features than both the official Direct DLL and the COM object.
    
## Extra features

Besides most of the COM methods, some of the unique DDLL methods are also exposed in adapted forms, namely the methods from `DYMatrix.pas`, especially `GetCompressedYMatrix` (check the source files for more information).

Since no GUI components are used in the FreePascal DLL, we are experimenting with different ways of handling OpenDSS errors. Currently, the `DSS.Text.Command` call checks for OpenDSS errors (through the `DSS.Error` interface) and converts those to Python exceptions. Ideally every error should be converted to Python exceptions, but that could negatively impact performance. You can manually trigger an error check by calling the function `CheckForError()` from the main module.


## Installing

On all major platforms, you can install directly from pip:

```
    pip install dss_python
```

Or, if you're using the Anaconda distribution, you can try:

```
    conda install -c dss-extensions dss_python
```

Binary wheels are provided for all major platforms (Windows, Linux and MacOS) and many combinations of Python versions (3.5 to 3.9). If you have issues with a specific version, please open an issue about it. Conda packages support at least Python 3.6 to 3.9 (varying according to the release).

After a successful installation, you can then import the `dss` module from your Python interpreter.

## Building

Get the repository:

```
    git clone https://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_python.git
```    
    
Assuming you successfully built or downloaded the DSS C-API DLLs (check [its repository](http://github.com/dss-extensions/dss_capi/) for instructions), keep the folder organization as follows:

```
dss_capi/
dss_python/
```

Open a command prompt in the `dss_python` subfolder and run the build process:

```
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
```

If you are familiar with `conda-build`, there is a complete recipe to build DSS C-API, KLUSolve(X) and DSS Python in the `conda` subfolder.

Example usage
=============

If you were using `win32com` in code like:

```python
import win32com.client 
dss_engine = win32com.client.gencache.EnsureDispatch("OpenDSSEngine.DSS")
```

or `comtypes`:

```python
import comtypes.client
dss_engine = comtypes.client.CreateObject("OpenDSSEngine.DSS")
```

you can replace that fragment with:
```python
import dss
dss_engine = dss.DSS
```

If you need the mixed-cased handling (that is, you were not using early bindings with win32com), add a call to `dss.use_com_compat()`.

Assuming you have a DSS script named `master.dss`, you should be able to run it as shown below:

```python
import dss
dss_engine = dss.DSS

dss_engine.Text.Command = "compile c:/dss_files/master.dss"
dss_engine.ActiveCircuit.Solution.Solve()
voltages = dss_engine.ActiveCircuit.AllBusVolts

for i in range(len(voltages) // 2):
    print('node %d: %f + j%f' % (i, voltages[2*i], voltages[2*i + 1]))
```


~~If you want to play with the experimental OpenDSS-PM interface (from OpenDSS v8), it is installed side-by-side and you can import it as:~~ -- temporarily disabled in DSS Python 0.10.5. Check back in a few months.

```python
import dss.v8
dss_engine = dss.v8.DSS
```

~~Although it is experimental, most of its funcionality is working. Depending on your use-case, the parallel interface can be an easy way of better using your machine resources. Otherwise, you can always use general distributed computing resources via Python.~~

~~Beware the v8 alternative can present issues and it should be removed as soon as all OpenDSS 8+ features are integrated into the default version.~~

Testing
=======
Since the DLL is built using the Free Pascal compiler, which is not officially supported by EPRI, the results are validated running sample networks provided in the official OpenDSS distribution. The only modifications are done directly by the script, removing interactive features and some other minor issues. Most of the sample files from the official OpenDSS repository are used for validation.

The validation scripts is `tests/validation.py` and requires the same folder structure as the building process. You need `win32com` to run it on Windows.


As of version 0.11, the full validation suite can be run on the three supported platforms. This is possible by saving the official COM DLL output and loading it on macOS and Linux. We hope to automate this validation in the future.

Roadmap
=======
Besides bug fixes, the main funcionality of this library is mostly done. Notable desirable features that may be implemented are:

- More and better documentation
- Plotting and reports integrated in Python.
- Parallel-machine properties (disabled in DSS Python 0.10.5, to be reworked).

Expect news about these items by version 0.11.

Questions?
==========
If you have any question, feel free to open a ticket on GitHub, or contact directly me through email (pmeira at ieee.org). Please allow me a few days to respond.
