    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "DSS-Python and OpenDSSDirect.py can use the plotting extension to enable the plot commands as seen in the official OpenDSS through our **alternative implementation** (currently known as DSS C-API).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this feature is to achieve similar results, but there is no intention of achieving pixel-perfect results, for various reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation does not reuse the concept of creation [`.dsv` files on disk](https://sourceforge.net/p/electricdss/code/3706/tree/trunk/Version8/Distrib/Doc/Partial%20Key%20to%20DSV%20files.pdf), since we avoid creating files when possible. Still, for compatibility, some features do require creating other files.\n",
    "\n",
    "As seen in this notebook, many of the official OpenDSS examples work as-is, so you can further explore the OpenDSS documentation and examples for more.\n",
    "\n",
    "This plotting implementation was motivated by a few points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Provide a better (and more complete) experience for users of DSS outside of Windows, especially Linux and macOS users, but also online environments such as Google Colaboratory and JupyterHub installations.\n",
    "- Allow running and reusing archived OpenDSS scripts as-is. This includes some of the official OpenDSS material from EPRI, archived code repositories and datasets from users in general (e.g. results from MSc and PhD works, papers).\n",
    "- Allow easier customization of plots. This is a commonly requested feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Known issues and limitations:**\n",
    "- The sizing of the markers may differ from the DSSView.exe; we will probably need a mapping function to address this.\n",
    "- Custom interactive/inspection is not implemented yet.\n",
    "- `plot evolution` and `plot energymeter` are not implemented. The command `di_plot`, which is implemented, already covers some similar functionality as `plot energymeter`.\n",
    "\n",
    "See also \"Future development\" below."

    "## Enabling and using the plotting features\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Importing will register an IPython magic and some integration functions for file outputs.\n",
    "- Importing will set `AllowChangeDir` to false.\n",
    "- When plotting is enabled, `AllowForms` is set to true.\n",

    "Visual Studio Code is also a great environment for notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we use matplotlib, users can optionally configure the plotting backend to use SVG (vector files) instead of PNG bitmaps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```ipython\n",

    "\n",
    "To adjust sizes, panning and so on, one of the interactive matplotlib backends could be useful. See for example [`ipympl`] at https://matplotlib.org/ipympl/.

    "## Future development\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, only a matplotlib backend is implemented. The matplotlib package was targeted due to its popularity, versatility and quantility of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plans to provide alternative plotting backends someday. For example, Plotly, Bokeh and eCharts are some candidates. A Python level API will also be exposed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to implement syntax highlighting too. This will be investigated for JupyterLab 4.0. A Jupyter kernel for running pure DSS scripts could be developed to go along.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the features mature, some of them may move to the package \"AltDSS\" (work-in-progress), which will provide a modern interface to our alternative DSS engine and also some niceties for the official OpenDSS engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides a few missing plots, some of the implementation ones can be polished in a future release, either by default or by toggling an option. Colormaps and colorbars are one example we should use instead of the manual colormapping in general data plots, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reading a plot from `.dsv` files created by the official OpenDSS could also be added. Using our full plotting backend with the official OpenDSS is not possible, but we could expose an user-friendly API to reuse our code with the official COM implementation."
